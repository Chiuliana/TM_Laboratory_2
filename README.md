Life’s Arena Showdown

Welcome to Life’s Arena Showdown, an immersive game built in Unity that combines the fundamental rules of Conway's Game of Life with exciting new elements. Set in a dynamic arena where cells vie for survival and dominance, players must strategize and adapt to conquer the evolving landscape.

Rules:

Life’s Arena Showdown adheres to the standard rules of Conway's Game of Life:
* A living cell with two or three living neighbors survives to the next generation.
* A living cell with fewer than two living neighbors dies from underpopulation.
* A living cell with more than three living neighbors dies from overpopulation.
* A dead cell with exactly three living neighbors becomes a living cell through reproduction.
  
In addition to these rules, the game introduces two new elements:

* 		Warriors (Pressing ‘W’): Introduces warriots cells that erase neighboring cells upon creation.
* 		Suppliers (Pressing ‘A’): Generates a large square of dots, influencing the battlefield dynamics.
*      Clan Leaders (Pressing ‘R’): Add eternal cells that perpetually generate new cells, altering the course of the game.

Zones:

Life’s Arena Showdown features three distinct zones, each with its unique characteristics and color scheme:
* 		Supply Zone: Enhances cell generation speed, providing a strategic advantage.
* 		Kill Zone: Eradicates cells within its boundaries, reshaping the battlefield.
